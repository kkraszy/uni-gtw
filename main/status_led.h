/**
 * Status LED driver — LEDC-based breathing/pulsing indicator.
 *
 * GPIO and enable/disable are read from gateway_config_t.hardware.gpio_status_led.
 * hardware.gpio_status_led == -1 means "no LED / disabled" — all calls are no-ops.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - Not connected to WiFi  → breathe slowly (3 s period)
 *   - AP mode                → breathe quickly (0.6 s period)
 *   - Connected to WiFi      → solid at 1/3 brightness
 *   - RX packet              → dim to 1/10 brightness for 100 ms, then restore
 *   - TX packet              → full brightness for 100 ms, then restore
 *
 * No FreeRTOS task is created.  All transitions use esp_timer + ledc_set_fade_time_and_start.
